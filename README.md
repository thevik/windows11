# What is this?

This is windows 11 UI clone I made in the span of 1 days. I got this idea on a bloging platform called dev.to in which a guy made a same thing in 7 days, so I thought to make it harder and try to make it in only 1 days.

So the journey started at 7PM on 7/17/2021, my plan was to make the taskbar and the wallpaper thing till I sleep and some icons in the wallpaper.

Now its 8/17/2021 I got like 12 hours to complete and then I wanted to make some pop-ups when you click in the taskbar and other icons will redirect to the official website of the app, and at last I have to style some hower things and then the windows 11 UI clone is complete.

I could bring changes to this if I feel something missing in the Ui which is very necesarry :D
